  - When a node receives a ``replSetMaintenance: true`` request, it
    adds a maintenance mode task to a queue of tasks. If the queue of
    tasks was empty and now is not, the node will transition to
    ``RECOVERING`` state and begin to reject read requests. When a node
    receives a ``replSetMaintenance: false`` request, it removes a
    maintenance mode task from the queue (even if that task was
    initiated by a different client). If the request empties 
    the maintenance mode task queue, the node will return to 
    ``SECONDARY`` state.
    
  - If you want to prevent a node from servicing reads, consider using
    :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member` instead.

  - See :doc:`/reference/replica-states/` for more information about
    replica set member states.

  See :doc:`/tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members` for an
  example replica set maintenance procedure to maximize availability
  during maintenance operations.
